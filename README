#  Rem:	This is a driver for the Xycom 2445 32-channel optically
#		isolated digital output Industry Pack (IP) with interrupts.
#		This driver also supports the Acromag IP445
#		series digital output cards.

EPICS Verions:
--------------
This driver has currently been built and tested at SLAC with EPICS 3.14.8.2
and EPICS 3.14.9.
EPICS OSI support has been added to this driver by Till Strauman at SLAC.

Operating System:
-------------------
This driver has only been tested under RTEMS since osi support has been added.

Hardware Notes:
-------------------
Output channels of this module are divided into four ports of eight channels each.
All channels within a port share a common signal connection with each other.
Isolation is provided between the ports and the IP logic.
In addition, bus isolation is provided between ports.

Each of the four ports has an SIP resistor pack that, when installed and a
power supply is connected to the user supply pin, pulls those 8 channels high.
The default SIP is 4.7K ohm per channel.

Note: If the SIP is installed but no power is provided to the user supply pin,
there is still a 9.4K ohm path between the outputs that can cause crosstalk
problems if your outputs drive TTL inputs.

How to use this module in your IOC
------------------
1.	Add the following lines in your iocTop/configure/RELEASE:
XY2445=$(EPICS_MODULES)/xy2445/$(XY2445_MODULE_VERSION)

2.	
For XyCom 2445, copy the following file to your iocTop/<iocName>/<iocName>App/Db directory:
	xy2445App/Db/xy2440.substitutions
For Acromag IP445, copy the following file to your iocTop/<iocName>/<iocName>App/Db directory:
	xy2445App/Db/ip440.substitutions
Customize as needed for your IOC

3.
For XyCom 2445, add the following lines in your iocTop/<iocName>/<iocName>App/Db/Makefile:
DB += xy2445.template
DB += xy2445.db
For Acromag IP445, add the following lines in your iocTop/<iocName>/<iocName>App/Db/Makefile:
DB += ip445.template
DB += ip445.db

4.	Add the following lines in your iocTop/<iocName>/<iocName>App/src/Makefile:
Note: Same for Xycom or Acromag as they use the same driver
<iocName>_DBD += Xy2445.dbd
<iocName>_LIBS += Xy2445

5.	Add the following lines in your iocTop/<iocName>/iocBoot/ioc<iocName>/st.cmd,
selecting the Xycom or Acromag as needed.
# Initialize IPAC carrier
# The 2nd parameter is the base I/O address set by the jumpers on your carrier board
# Make sure this address doesn't conflict with other boards.
ipacAddCarrier(&xy9660,"0x0000")

# Initialize digital input module
# Set card to the carrier number, which is 0 for the first ipacAddCarrier() call and
# increments as other carrier cards are added.
# The slot numbers are 0..3 corresponding to slots A..D on the carrier card
# More than one digital input card can be used as long as the name and slot # differ.
# xy2445Create( <name>, <card>, <slot> )
xy2445Create( "do0", 0, 0 )

# Load the EPICS records
# For XyCom 2445:
dbLoadRecords("db/xy2445.db","CARD=do0")
# For Acromag IP445:
# dbLoadRecords("db/ip445.db","CARD=do0")
